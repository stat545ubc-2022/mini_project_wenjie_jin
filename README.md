**Project Overview** <br>
This is the mini-project which is exploring the cancer_sample dataset to find which attributes can help predict the cancer is benign or malicious. And this repository contains two parts, which are milestone 1 and 2.


**Getting Started** <br>
To view the analysis report, open mini-project-1.md or mini-project-2.md. 

To modify the report or to reproduce your desired result, open the .Rmd file in a code editor of your choice (ex, vs code), modify the code as you like and then knit to document then you should be able to get the result.

Finally, If you want, you can create a new branch and upload your code to your created branch and do a pull request.

Thank you
